# Random-Shapes-Python

This python project deals with python's random and tkinter imports. I created three shape classes with randomized values and then offered three ways to display the results. One by file output, two by GUI, and three by output to console. The fourth option is to exit the program.

NOTE: using file output will create a file within the folder that the python project is in.
